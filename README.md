# Data Science and MLops Project 

Given a dataset of movie reviews the task was to provide a python code for a given output and do further Data Analysis and ML model buiding tasks which are necessary as a Data Scientist. 

This project is made 100% in python and uses libraries such as pandas, numpy, scipy, seaborn and etc.

# Hi, this is Niyati and Giselle two young data science students trying to do our MLOps LAB ISA

The question given was assume that you have joined As Data Scientist for one of top Data science Company.

It is a pair programming – you can carry out work with any other batchmate of your choice.

Given the following some of roles of Data Engineer,
- Extracting and integrating data from a variety of sources—data collection.
- Preparing the data for analysis: processing the data by applying suitable transformations to prepare the data for analysis and other downstream tasks. Includes cleaning, validating, and transforming data and wrangling etc.
- Designing, building, and maintaining data pipelines that encompass the flow of data from source to destination. 
- Design and maintain infrastructure for data collection, processing, and storage—infrastructure management.

Consider the first 2 roles,  
- Demonstrate that you have necessary skill to carry out the first 2 roles for the data set given (read the description below to understand the challenge) apart from other data engineering tasks by writing the code in python. Please note that you have limited time to prove your skill
- Demonstrate further that you have Machine learning background by writing the code in python or any autoML tool  to build appropriate  ML model  with required metrics ( the nature of data may dictate either regression problem or classification problem)

 _The movie reviews website was very happy with your deliverable for the previous assignment and now they have a new request for you. The previous consultant had created a chart for them which is illustrated on the next slide. However, the Python code used to create the diagram has since been lost and cannot be recovered. Your task is to come up with the code that will re-create the same chart making it look as close as possible to the original A new dataset has been supplied. The chart is attached._
